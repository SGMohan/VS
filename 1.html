        Originally occupied by the Toda people, the area came under the rule of the East India Company in the 18th
        century. It
        later served as the summer capital of Madras Presidency. The economy is based on the hospitality industry
        serving
        tourism and <span>agriculture.</span> In 1818, J. C. Whish and N. W. Kindersley, assistants to John Sullivan,
        then collector of Coimbatore district, visited
        Kotagiri near Rengaswamy peak. Sullivan established his residence there and reported to the Board of Revenue on
        31 July
        1819.[9] He also started work on a road from Sirumugai which was completed in May 1823 and extended up to
        Coonoor
        between 1830â€“32. In August 1868, the Nilgiris was separated from the Coimbatore district and James Wilkinson
        Breeks was
        appointed its commissioner.[9] On 1 February 1882, Nilgiris was made a district and Richard Wellesley Barlow who
        was the
        then commissioner became the first collector of Nilgiris.[8] The region serves as the summer capital of the
        Madras
        Presidency and was visited by British officials as a summer retreat.The town is connected to the plains by the
        Nilgiri ghat roads and Nilgiri Mountain Railway.
